# Bubble sort

Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order (ascending or descending arrangement). The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed
which indicates that the list is sorted.

## Algorithm

```Java
static void bubbleSort(int arr[], int n)
    {
        int i, j, temp;
        boolean swapped;
        for (i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)
        {
            swapped = false;
            for (j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++)
            {
                if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1])
                {
                    // swap arr[j] and arr[j+1]
                    temp = arr[j];
                    arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                    arr[j + 1] = temp;
                    swapped = true;
                }
            }
 
            // IF no two elements were
            // swapped by inner loop, then break
            if (swapped == false)
                break;
        }
    }
```
